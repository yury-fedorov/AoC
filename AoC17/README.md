# Advent of Code 2017 in Rust, Scala 3, C#, C 23 

## Technological Stack & Conventions
* Rust 2024
* Scala 3.7.4
* C 23
* .NET 10 (LTS)

## TODO
1. Day06 code is absent? Seems it has never been committed?

## Interesting Parts
1. Day23 - pure C 23
2. Scala 3.7.4 - first 3 days

## Tech Debt
1. Too many stacks: Rust, Scala 3, C 23 but also C# - would be great to get rid at least of .NET as no added value
