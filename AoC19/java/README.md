Java 17 (LTS)
- Day 22: Slam Shuffle (cards)

Eventual future improvements:
- Day 21: Springdroid Adventure (may do better assembly?)
- Day 16: Flawed Frequency Transmission - task 2 takes 4 h 24 m - could be parallized and further improved
- Day 17: Set and Forget - manually composed path and part of pattern research
