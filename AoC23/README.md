# Advent of Code 2023 in Go

## Technological Stack & Conventions
* Go 1.20 (as 1.21 is missing on https://github.com)
* [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/guide)

## TODO
1. Day10 Part2 - count properly if we are in or out of the tube.
2. Day12 Part2 - combinatorics
3. Day17 - Clumsy Crucible
4. Day18 - Lavaduct Lagoon

## Interesting Parts
1. `Day03` - `aoc.Abs()` with generics for `int` and `int64`
2. `Day04` - `aoc.Pow()` with generics for `int` and `int64`
3. `Day05` - channels and goroutines

## Tech Debt
1. `Day05` - `Sort` and (binary) `Search`
